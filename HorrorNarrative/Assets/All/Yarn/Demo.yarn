    Widow: My husband, my daughter, my mother // Will replace with names

    Villager2: We've all lost people
    Villager2: Your grief is no more than any other
    DFL: The question isn't who has lost more
    DFL: The question is should we not end it now?
    Widow: What do you mean?
    Widow: As in...
    Villager2: Baker! Come
    DFL: The struggling, yes
    Villager2: Speak some sense to these people

            Player: Yes
            Player: It called me 'Malignant'
            DFL: 'Malignant'?
            Player: It viewed me as some sort of tumor
            Player: I imagine it views all of us the same
            DFL: And that means something?
            -> We're as vile to them as they are to us
            -> We're not tumors
            Player: We can't possibly let these creatures destroy our hope
            DFL: It's foolish to believe that us ants, given enough hope, will overcome the foot of an elephant
            DFL: Those who wish for some agency in their passing, take this last night
            DFL: We will congregate here tomorrow morning
