# Thuleanx and Cathardigan Collab Github

Source code and assets for entry in [Narrative Game Jam 3](https://itch.io/jam/narrative-jam-3-southern-illinois-university-cola-digital-humanities-lab).

## Structure
This details the structure of the project
- /HorrorNarrative -> the unity project
	- /Assets/All -> all custom (self made) files. Unity tends to generate files all over the place in /Assets so I'm putting ours in a subfolder
		- /Aseprite -> all aseprite files
		- /Yarn -> all Yarn programs / dialogue trees
- /HorrorFMOD -> the FMOD project
